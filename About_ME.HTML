    <u><h1>About ME</h1></u><br><br>
    <p>
        "Hello there! I'm SIDDHARTHA KOMMU an undergraduate student pursuing Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT Hyderabad. Being born and raised in Hyderabad, Telangana, education has been an integral part of my journey. I completed most of my schooling at K.V.S (Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan) and spent my 9th and 10th grades at D.A.V (Dayanand Anglo Vedic Public School). I successfully passed my 10th with an impressive 83% from the CBSE board.<br><br>

Driven by my passion for knowledge, I continued my education at Narayana, where I studied PCM (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics) in 11th and 12th grades. I worked hard and achieved an outstanding 98% in my 12th board exams. The culmination of my efforts led me to crack the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) with an All India Rank of '6131,' allowing me to fulfill my dream of joining IIT.<br><br>

Aside from academics, I have a vibrant set of hobbies that keep me engaged and motivated. I find solace in the water as swimming has become a beloved pastime of mine. It not only keeps me physically active but also provides a sense of peace and tranquility.<br><br>

Cooking is another passion that I thoroughly enjoy. Exploring flavours, experimenting with ingredients, and creating delightful dishes bring out my creative side. It's a way for me to unwind and express my culinary skills.<br><br>

Additionally, hitting the gym is an essential part of my routine. I believe in maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle, and the gym provides the perfect space for me to challenge myself physically and work towards my fitness goals.<br><br>

Beyond my hobbies, I have developed various skills along the way. I take pride in my fast-typing ability, with a personal record of 86 words per minute. I am also good at creating 3-D models using Solid Edge software. Moreover, I have a good command of HTML and CSS, enabling me to craft visually appealing and functional web pages.<br><br>

One of my strengths lies in building connections with others. Making friends comes naturally to me, and I appreciate the value of meaningful relationships in both personal and professional settings.
